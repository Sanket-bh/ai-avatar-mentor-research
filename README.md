## AI Avatar Mentor – Research Project (IEEE PuneCon 2025)

This repository accompanies a team-based research paper titled
“Development of an Interactive AI Mentor: A Full-Body Digital Human for Real-Time Conversational Learning”,
published at the IEEE PuneCon 2025 conference.

The work explores how conversational AI, speech technologies, and 3D avatars
can be combined to create an interactive digital mentor for online learning.

### About the Research
The proposed system integrates:
- Speech-to-Text for capturing learner input
- Large Language Models for reasoning and response generation
- Text-to-Speech for expressive audio output
- Full-body 3D avatars with lip-sync and gestures
- A web-based frontend for real-time interaction

The design is guided by Cognitive Load Theory and evaluated using metrics such as
knowledge retention, user engagement, latency, and learner satisfaction.

### My Role in the Project
This was a collaborative research project completed as part of a student team.
My contributions included:
- Participating in system design discussions and research planning
- Assisting in architecture analysis and technology selection
- Supporting experimentation, evaluation, and result interpretation
- Contributing to paper writing and revisions

### Publication
- Conference: IEEE PuneCon 2025
- Paper: “Development of an Interactive AI Mentor: A Full-Body Digital Human for Real-Time Conversational Learning”
- Status: Accepted and published in IEEE proceedings

### Note
This repository is intended to provide research context and documentation.
The complete implementation is maintained collectively by the research team
and is not published here as a standalone production system.
